# Save The Date - Front End

A front end application which acts as a digital save the date where your wedding or event guests can enter their details for future guest management

This is part of a full stack application I have built which includes [Save-The-Date-API](https://github.com/RebekahCodes/Save-The-Date-API)

## Features
✨ Sleek landing page which acts as a digital save the date featuring couple photo (replace with your own!)<br/>
✨ Sign-up form for wedding guests to enter their contact details for future communcations<br/>
✨ Mobile first responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes<br/>

## Roadmap
After initially building Save The Date as a personl project to help manage guest for my upcoming wedding, I am now focussing on adding additional features to improve is functionality and enable other users to easily implement this application to use for their own events' guest management. 

- [x] Allow multi-guest household submssions
- [x] Toggle to hide/show multiple guests
- [ ] Add more robust form validation
- [ ] Checkbox option to use the same email address for whole household
- [ ] Add form submission confirmation
- [ ] Verify guest is invited before form submission
